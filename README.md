# Risky Dice | JavaScript Game
## by webdevterri
### About
This repo is my own version of the Dice Game we created in the Scrimba Front End Developers Career Path Course. 
#### Tech Stack:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### What I added:
- Take a Risk button
- Super Gamble button

### Future Updates:
I have other ideas to make this game even more my own. I will be implementing these features and designs and uploading the updated versions here as I work on them.
